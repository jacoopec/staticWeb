<h2>Bachelor's degree</h2>
<p>I studied mechanic engineering as my bachelor's degree, and then I switched towards other subjects guided by the interest
    of being able to understand how other aspects of an industrial product work, like sowftware and electronics.
    I started my master's degree in mechatronics engineering in september 2019 and I ended this path in April 2022.
    Shortly after that date I started working as a Software embedded developer in a company in Bolzano, but then I decided to return
    to Parma after 2 months, because I wanted something different.
